--list
    Lists all of the repositories that are going to be backed up and the remote repository to which they will be matched.

--include <repository to include> [remote for repository]
    Adds a repository to the backup list.

--exclude <repository to exclude>
    Removes a repository from the backup list.

--backup
    Iterates through the backup list. For each repository untracked files are added and a commit is made. The new commit is then pushed to that repository's remote repository

--recover
    Iterates through the backup list. For each repository the remote is cloned in. DOES NOT REBUILD THE PATH TO ANY REPOSITORY! YOU MUST DO THIS YOURSELF! You will need to manually clone the settings file from where it is backed up to C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\gitbackSettings
