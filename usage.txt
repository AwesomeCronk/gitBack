help
    Displays this help message.

list
    Lists all of the repositories that are going to be backed up and the remote repository to which they will be matched.

include <repository> <remote>
    Adds a repository to the backup list. <repository> is the path to the local repository and <remote> is the name of the git remote to back up to.

exclude <repository>
    Removes a repository from the backup list.

backup
    Iterates through the backup list. For each repository untracked files are added and a commit is made and pushed.

recover -- NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
    Iterates through the backup list. For each repository the remote is cloned in. DOES NOT REBUILD THE PATH TO ANY REPOSITORY! YOU MUST DO THIS YOURSELF! You will need to manually recover C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\gitBackConfig. If the specified remote repository is ahead in commits, changes likely will not be pushed.

version
    Displays the current version.
